# P-M Interaction Curve for Design of Columns (IS Code)

This Python script facilitates the generation of a normalized P-M interaction curve for the design of square and rectangular columns, adhering to the guidelines of the IS code. Key features include:

1. **Flexible Reinforcement Configuration:**
   The script allows for any number of rebars in a 4-sided equally distributed reinforcement configuration (default: 20 rebars). Easily adjustable to accommodate variations.

2. **Steel Type Customization:**
   Although it is configured for Fe 415 steel's stress-strain values, the script can be adapted to utilize different steel types, provided their respective stress-strain curves are available.

3. **Data Export to Excel:**
   The script saves generated data into an Excel sheet, providing a convenient way to conduct column calculations and further analysis.

4. **Ease of Customization:**
   The code is well-commented, enabling effortless customization and modifications to suit specific project requirements.

Utilize this script to efficiently generate P-M interaction curves, aiding in the robust design of columns as per IS code standards.
